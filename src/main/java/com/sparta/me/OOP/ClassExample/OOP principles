Encapsulation(private) - Encapsulation is the mechanism of hiding of data implementation by restricting access to public methods.
                Instance variables are kept private and accessor methods are made public to achieve this.

Abstraction(easy to use) - Using abstract class/Interface we express the intent of the class rather than the actual implementation.
              In a way, one class should not know the inner details of another in order to use it, just knowing the interfaces should be good enough.

Inheritance(extends) - Inheritances expresses “is-a” and/or “has-a” relationship between two objects.
              Using Inheritance, In derived classes we can reuse the code of existing super classes.

Polymorphism(overload / override) - It means one name many forms.
                    Static polymorphism is achieved using method overloading and dynamic polymorphism using method overriding.
