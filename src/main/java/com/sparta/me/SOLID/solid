SOLID PRINCIPLES

Single responsibility

    Each class should have only one sole purpose,
    and not be filled with excessive functionality.

Open Closed

    Classes should be open for extension but closed
    for modification

Liskov Substitution

    Every subclass or derived class should be substitutable
    for their base or parent class

Interface Segregation

    Interfaces should not force classes to do what they can't
    do. Large interfaces should be divided into smaller ones.

Dependency Inversion

    Components should depend on abstractions not on concretions.
